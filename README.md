This is my partial work for my 3200 Test
I was unable to run the final three fragments due to dependency issues so I worked mostly using this
I adjusted the view model and overrode the state change to keep the timer running when it changes states
I've uploaded it as a zip file because my github would not connect
To run this, download the zip file and run the app using CompileSDK of 30 or more
